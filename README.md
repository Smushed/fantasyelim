## What this app is
This app will be a mix of a daily and season long NFL fantasy game. The goal of this is to get into a group and set a lineup every week with the restriction to only play each player one time.
- Each player in the group has access to every player, and they can play the same player every week.
- They fill out a roster of players and the after the game the stats are scored and their scores are compared to one another
- The scores from each week are kept, and the highest total at the end of the season wins.
- Should also feature some sort of head to head mechanics.

### TODO 
API http://nflgame.derekadair.com/
- Figure out how to use this thing, if I even can do this.
If this doesn't work then I don't really see how I can do this. The Stats for individual players are not easy to find. This seems like something they keep under lock and key with good reason.
