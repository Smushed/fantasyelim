## What this app is
This app will be a mix of a daily and season long NFL fantasy game. The goal of this is to get into a group and set a lineup every week with the restriction to only play each player one time.
- Each player in the group has access to every player, and they can play the same player every week.
- They fill out a roster of players and the after the game the stats are scored and their scores are compared to one another
- The scores from each week are kept, and the highest total at the end of the season wins.
- Should also feature some sort of head to head mechanics.

## MVP
The MVP for this project is to have users sign in and add players to their roster. There are notable differences between the MVP and the usual expected features in other fantasy apps.
- Users can log in and pick a roster
- The weeks and seasons change based on time
- The rosters lock before the Thursday game
- Users can see each others rosters for the current week
- There is a leaderboard to compare scores
- The scoring system will be locked down
- D/ST is not an option

## Future ideas
- The app will display the players stats for the last week / season
- Players can join groups and have set the points for their group
- Users can add players to future weeks. They are not locked into only picking one week at a time
