## Fantasy Eliminator
THis is a game which combines daily fantasy with the challenge of a year long game. All players of this game have access to every player who is on a roster in the NFL however, they may only play each player one time.
- For example: If you were to play Tom Brady week 1, then you are unable to play Tom Brady week 2-17. You can play any other QB in that slot.
